# OpenIPF-Analysis
A data analysis project I am working on covering the OpenIPF dataset, where the information regarding all IPF sanctioned powerlifting meets is stored. The current aim of the project is to gain a better understanding of the different coefficients used within powerlifting to hopefully find the most fair method for judging lifters across classes and divisions.
